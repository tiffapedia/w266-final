# Intralingual Translation without Reference

With the advent of big data, we have achieved impressive feats in interlingual translation from one language to another. In this paper, we wanted to explore the possibility of intralingual ‘translation’ of sentences between topics in the same language, using data collected from the social media platform Twitter. Specifically, we will automatically identify and rewrite sentences from one geographical region of North America to another.  We will do so without using reference data, and generate the translator model in three different ways: enhancing a particular regional pattern in a LSTM and CNN encoder-decoder models and training a LSTM encoder-decoder model adversarially. Translations will be evaluated both by coherence and by retranslation.
